                    <p>We bought a male bunny at PetLand on March 29,2021 and named him Cookie but I call him Coco for short. According to an employee, a bunny at a young age, you can't tell if they're male or female so you basically have to hope for the best or wait till they get older. But at PetLand, they don't sell grown up bunnies so you end up having to buy them when they're young.</p>
